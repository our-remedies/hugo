### FOR SKIN SYMPTOMS

NU•LOESS by Thaumaturge is an unusual curative remedy based on homeopathic requirements. Homeopathy is a scientific philosophy that assumes that there is an internal wisdom within the body to heal itself. Homeopathy then provides relief for pain and discomfort by allowing the body�s natural defenses to heal itself. NU•LOESS provides the impetus toward healing through a homeopathically prepared combination of herbs specific to skin symptoms. NU•LOESS is a healing balm made of homeopathically prepared substances held in a base of glycerin and petrolatum. Consider the following potentials of each ingredient.

**Hamamelis Virginica** (Witch Hazel): is specific to venous congestion, varicose veins and hemorrhoids, with bruised soreness. Hamamelis relaxes veins and appeases engorgement and supercedes as a remedy for pain. Often called upon for varicose veins and ulcers, Hamamelis is wonderful, too, for inflammations in the veins and on the skin. In this formula Hamamelis was chosen for its subtle healing potential when the situation calls for relaxation of tissue, for ease of pain and as a balm for inflammation to relax toward healing.

**Collisonia Canadesis** (Stone Root): is an old remedy for rectal disquiets as in resulting hemorrhoids, piles, constriction or sticking pains in the rectum and/or on the lips. Collisonia deals with aches, protrusions of tissue, and when there can be pain or bleeding from exertion or stress upon delicate tissue. Collisonia brings sure relief where the specific area is warm, moist and particularly where small muscles in constant tension are interplaying in their work. Examples would be the �puckering� action of the rectum or of the lips � both intricate muscles structures affected by emotions, heart symptoms, respiratory ailments, menstruation, or liver stagnation.

**Primala Obconica** (Primrose): is ideally suited when there are blisters on the skin and the tissue is tense as in moist eczema whether it be eruptions, blisters or else cracking. Itching can be a problem as part of the skin symptoms.

**Taraxacum** (Dandelion): has been chosen for this remedy due to its personality to affect the liver which when disquieted or dis-eased will symptomize as cold sores, fever blisters and hemorrhoids. Taraxacum is especially useful when along with skin symptoms.

**Valeriana** (Valerian): was chosen as a remedy in this formula for its action when over-sensitiveness becomes a physical debilitation and resultant nervous affections such as pressure, constipation, spasms and pain create hurt at soft tissue areas.

**Suggested Use:** NU•LOESS is an ointment as a restorative. Massage a tad of the cream onto the affected place and keep the area moist with the salve. Once the salve is applied body heat will warm up the oil base and the salve can then be easily caressed into the area.
