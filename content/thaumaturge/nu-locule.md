### BREAK ADDICTIONS AND CALM NERVES

It is easy to categorize habits as bad, thinking narrowly of alcohol consumption and smoking tobacco or some other form of �smoke� as the conclusion of all that is bad. Myriad compulsions are as negative. Tics, chewing one's nails, twisting and playing with one's hair, binging on certain foods, fastidious behaviors about cleanliness, or orderliness or detailing one's perfect composure are examples of relatives to "bad habits". Raging anger, emotional disquiets and misaligned self-concept are habitual dis-stabilization of mental, emotional and physical connection.
