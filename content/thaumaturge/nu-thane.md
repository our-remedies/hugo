### CIRCULATION BOOSTER

NU•THANE belongs to the <cite>Thaumaturge</cite> line of holistic remedies designed for those who desire healing, seeking it through natural means.

NU•THANE is a specific remedy for the heart. The name THANE implies "defender, a soldier for a higher cause" and in our body the heart is a dominant force helping us in our defense to stay well.

NU•THANE is for cleansing of veins and arteries, intensifying circulation thus alleviating water retention, purging the kidneys and bladder of debris, enhancing the brain with increased circulation of nutrients, strengthening the very heart and its action and its blood supply. NU•THANE deals with issues of libido, energy, warmth and vibrance.

The active ingredients included are:

**Buchu** (136 mg): is for treatment of water retention and urinary tract infections. Its tonic qualities are also specific to prostate problems and yeast infections. Buchu has been included specifically to relieve water retention about the lungs.

**Zinc Citrate** (26 mg): is a major mineral. Citrate was chosen for its ease of absorption. Zinc acts like a "traffic policeman" in the body directing the efficient maintenance of enzyme systems and cells in the uninhibited flow of body processes. Zinc helps in the making of insulin and is essential for protein synthesis. Because it helps to maintain an acid-alkaline balance, muscles "work" with smoother ease. Zinc is indicated for its importance in brain function to increase mental alertness. Studies indicate that zinc decreases cholesterol, accelerates healing time and promotes growth.

**L-Proline** (270 mg): is an isolate amino acid included to balance electrolytes in cases of dehydration which causes an acid condition.

L-Proline is a major constituent of collagen-the main fibrous protein found in bone, cartilage and other connective tissue. It helps in the maintenance and repair of joints and tendons.

**Lycii Berries** (93 mg): are good tonic for kidney exhaustion linked to overwork or old age. They are included in the remedy, also, for blood pressure associated with liver disharmony, which causes constriction of veins, and arteries bringing on suffering of varicosity. Lycii Berries help, too, to lower blood sugar.

**Deer Antler** (95 mg): You will probably find it amazing that this ingredient has been added but its inherent "goodness" is its soothing and revitalizing qualities which aid with a fresher and more assertive attitude about life in general. Its emotional uplifting aspect is worthy but its real strength intensifies heart action.

**Beta Sitosterol** (30 mg): is added to relax muscles, to relieve muscle spasms and that "charley-horse grip".

<cite>Possibly you might experience some light-headedness for the first two days due to the Beta Sitosterol's enhancement of oxygen to the brain. NU•THANE is food which nurtures, so insist on two quarts of water with a dash of lime juice for the first three days then at least one quart daily to purge the debris broken loose in the cleaning process.</cite>

**Suggested Use**: One (1) tablet after each of three (3) meals and one (1) before bedtime: or one (1) after breakfast, two (2) after lunch and one (1) after dinner. Up to four (4) tablets a day.
