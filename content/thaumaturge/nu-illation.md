### IMPROVE PANCREATIC ACTIVITY

NU•ILLATION belongs to the collection of eclectic remedies designed by <cite>Thaumaturge</cite> for those who seek healing through natural "helps".

NU•ILLATION is a specific remedy for enhancing the workability of the pancreas � especially when the production of insulin is erratic, either hypo as low production or hyper as overly much.

NU•ILLATION addresses a wide range of issues that result from an ineffectual pancreas. Designed to help the pancreas secrete pancreatic juice into ducts and hormones into the blood, NU•ILLATION normalizes the insulin preceptors to regulate insulin.

All forms of diabetes benefit from exercise therapy to reduce problems with obesity, heart disease and depression.

NU•ILLATION has only two components � both herbs. The following brief expose will give you a concept of why NU•ILLATION has such potential toward healing.

**Sarsaparilla** (465 mg); stimulates metabolism and aides with digestion to alleviate gas and bloating. As an herb, it helps with edema, containing diuretic activity to help increase the elimination of chlorides and uric acid. Anti-inflammatory in action, Sarsaparilla increases circulation to rheumatic joints to help relieve arthritis and other inflammatory conditions.

Components in Sarsaparilla aid in the production of testosterone and progesterone, which helps to remediate sexual impotence, physical debility and weakness. Sarsaparilla is a tonic to help purify the blood and increases the flow of urine to dispel excess water retention.

Renowned for its potential to accentuate the production of thymosin by the thymus, Sarsaparilla then plays a critical role in the body's defenses against infections. The thymus' health has an important role in the body's immune system and Sarsaparilla is effective as a stimulator to that particular gland.

**Senna** (10 mg); is an herb that has a stimulating laxative personality. It�s somewhat prompt cathartic action acts on nearly the entire intestinal tract to purge and cleanse it for greater absorption of nutrients to feed the body for wellness. Senna can appear as a reddish tint on the urine or the feces so do not be alarmed.

In small doses Senna will not tire the system. NU•ILLATION has a minimal addition of Senna as a working component. Senna enriches oxygen to the blood therefore, is very effective against eruptive diseases like skin ulcers or sores so typical with diabetes.

NU•ILLATION can be paired with NU•LACTONE for a more aggressive program or with NU•NEFARIOUS if a hiatal hernia is an aggravating issue.

**Suggested Use**: One (1) tablet, three (3) times a day on an empty stomach. Continue for two (2) weeks, then reduce to one (1) tablet a day, up to three (3) tablets, if needed. May take in combination with NU•LACTONE for a more aggressive program.
