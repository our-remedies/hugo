### HIATAL HERNIA DISCOMFORT RELIEF

NU•NEFARIOUS is an eclectic remedy designed by Thaumaturge to not only bring relief to the discomfort of a hiatal hernia but to also strengthen the abdominal muscle weakness that inherently allows for the malady.

NU•NEFARIOUS as a formulation is made up of the following components:

**Raw Spleen Concentrate** (10 mg): plays an important role in immune function for the white blood cells are produced as �natural killer cells� able to destroy cells that have become cancerous or infected with viruses. Raw spleen has been added to enhance the bodily immune activity. Due to the spleen�s strategic position it is affected by the upward pressure of a hiatal hernia. The stress against the spleen curtails the filtration of worn out blood cells and diminishes its salvaging of iron for future use. Tiredness is realized and blood pressure issues arise.

**Milk Thistle** (235 mg): is an antioxidant to protect against free radical scavengers. It has an overall effect on the whole body because of the function of the liver in protecting the immune system. This particular herb plays a major role in protecting, rejuvenating and restoring liver function. It helps prevent plaque buildup and hardening of the arteries. Because Milk Thistle is rich in bioflavonoids it increases membrane strength which relates to the discomfort of a hiatal hernia.

**Red Raspberry Leaves** (132 mg): is included with NU•NEFARIOUS to relieve nausea and stomach complaints. This particular herb is high in calcium so serves well to strengthen prolapsed muscles. As an adjunct Red Raspberry Leaves help to alleviate hiccoughing and excessive "burping" due to the negative condition of a hiatal hernia.

**Manganese** (10 mg): is used in energy production. In minute quantities manganese is needed for protein and fat metabolism, healthy nerves, a healthy immune system and blood sugar regulation. Herein manganese acts too as a hormone balancer, activating the parathyroid to do its part in muscle toning.

**Quercetin** (100 mg): is a bioflavonoid added to this program to reduce the allergic inflammatory response from which abdominal muscles become agitated. Quercetin's anti-allergy action as an antioxidant inhibits inflammatory compounds. In combination with the inherent enzymes of the Red Raspberry Leaves the absorption and concentration of Quercetin is increased into the tissue thereby nurturing the specific muscle(s).

**Black Current Oil** (64 mg): is a plant derived oil that contains gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), needed in this particular formulation to improve nerve function and help prevent diabetic nerve disease, aggravated by the constriction of the pancreas and its duct by the hiatal hernia pressure.

**Suggested Use**: Three (3) tablets before a meal; taken preferably at noon hour or at the middle of the workday. Or one (1) tablet before each meal, up to three (3) tablets a day.
