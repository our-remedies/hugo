### HAIR, SKIN, BONE AND NAIL STRENGTHENER

NU•OBDURATE is the second formulation in a line of herbal remedies designed for <cite>Thaumaturge</cite>. <cite>Thaumaturge</cite> is an ancient word suggesting �bringer of miracles� thusly it represents a collection of eclectic herbal formulas that are natural and, when used with prudence, does not cause side-effects, but rather strengthens, cleanses, nourishes and stimulates the body to heal itself.

<cite>Thaumaturge's</cite> first formulation NU•ZAREBA addresses metabolism specific to a healthful way to lose weight or to gain needed weight. Since both issues stem from similar causes, NU•ZAREBA addresses three underlying causes that can create the imbalance. Specific to overweight and or underweight is: an ongoing yeast infection (not so much a rash or discharge as more so fatigue and a craving for sweets); infestation of parasites or worms (symptoms of itching, disease, exhaustion, mucus, gas or bloating and bowel disquiet); thyroidal exhaustion (coldness of hands and feet, low back pain, skin dryness, hair loss and difficulty in losing or gaining weight or an almost mysterious weight change despite little food intake).

And now NU•OBDURATE is available. Named because it deals with issues of sluggish nature when the possibility of healing is stubbornly unmoved and needs a "jump-start" to begin the healing processes.
