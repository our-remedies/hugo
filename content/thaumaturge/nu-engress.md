### MUSCLE STRESS RELIEF

NU•EGRESS is the fifth formulation in a line of eclectic remedies designed for <cite>Thaumaturge</cite>. <cite>Thaumaturge</cite> represents a concept that nature provides food that heals.

NU•EGRESS is a combination of three herbs along with L-Glutathione, (an amino acid), which in effect singularly addresses the acid/alkaline pH balance of the body. An imbalance of the blood pH enlivens an environment wherein the muscles stiffen. In this condition muscles do not stretch nor contract with ease but feel taut and ache. The soreness lingers. Tight muscles pull at odd angles on joints and symptoms commonly referred to as rheumatism, gout, tennis elbow, stiff neck, spasms, cramps, tics, kidney and gall stones manifest.Balancing other remedies in partnership NU•EGRESS intensifies the healing outcome.

Included in NU•EGRESS is:

**Wild Lettuce** (142 mg): increases urine flow. It has sedative properties that address chronic pain, nervous disorders, and cramps. Oddly, too, it cleans out old and new accumulation of poison ivy, which by the way, will often settle in the joints and cause pain and spasms even years later. Wild lettuce helps, too, to balance pH from an acid.

**Sarsaparilla** (142 mg): is included as a glandular balancer. It increases circulation in rheumatic joints. Sarsaparilla provides Vitamin D and the mineral Copper-both excellent nutrients for the joints. It is a blood purifier-good for gout and joint aches. Because sarsaparilla is a hormone herb, it is inherently stimulating to the entire body.

**Eucalyptus** (120 mg): has antiseptic qualities and helps to prevent infections. It is a purifier and specific for pain, paralysis, stiff muscles, and spasms of muscles. Also, a stimulant, Eucalyptus will help to reduce blood sugar levels.

**L-Glutathione** (17 mg): is a specific amino acid that protects cell membranes from free radical damage. Studies show that it potentially breaks down fat peroxides that can contribute to congestion of the veins and arteries. L-Glutathione helps with energizing (anti-fatigue) through its action with the red blood cells. It is also valuable in its involvement with neutralizing toxins.
