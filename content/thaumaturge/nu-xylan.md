### OBSTRUCTED PASSAGES

NU•XYLAN by Thaumaturge is designed to deal with immune disorders which tell-tale as fibroid disfigurations resultant in gnarly and painful joints. NU•XYLAN is specific to rheumatic arthritis but the inherent potential is far greater for it also deals with vertigo, meniere�s disease, affections of the auditory nerves, deafness, sensitivity to sounds and buzzing in the ears. NU•XYLAN's combination can also address hookworms and roundworms which often are culprits beneath arthritic symptoms. Potentially NU•XYLAN will also address enlarged tonsils when an infection is the underlying cause and helps also to quiet intense pain in the joints.

NU•XYLAN is different operationally than NU•EGRESS although the two together as companions can add much healing when the symptoms deal with both bone and muscle discomforts, due to clogged passages like the urethra, the ears, pancreatic ducts, gallbladder ducts and similar passageways. NU•EGRESS deals with gout while NU•XYLAN deals with fibroid changes in passages that impede transportation of nutrients.

There are only three components in NU•XYLAN. Each is addressed for your consideration and information in the following brief exposes.

**Calcium** (50mg): amino acid chelate CITRATE is more effective in smaller doses spread throughout the day and before rest, as at bedtime. One thinks of calcium for the research which credits it as building strong bones. But its aptitude also conducts nerve transmissions, aids in blood clotting and helps to regulate heartbeat. Calcium is used to repair worn out parts of the body. I chose citrate for its ease of absorption.

You need to understand that anything that causes the body to become too acidic seems to leech calcium out of the bones. Meat, dairy products, soft drinks and sweets are mainline culprits. Calcium chelate is easier to absorb and a keystone nutrient to improve the tone and elasticity of our muscles and ligaments. Calcium play a key role to help transport nerve impulses from one part of the body to another to promote the contraction and relaxation of the muscles helping to keep us in a calm frame of mind and to ease stress and anxiety.

Calcium, even though in tiny increments, circulates in the blood helping to maintain a proper acid/alkaline balance. During physical or emotional stress more calcium is needed and is withdrawn from the bones and can cause much damage if not checked.

Calcium is important for normal kidney function, to ease depression, to relax muscle cramping and to act as an enzyme activator to effect adrenal production. Calcium has many merits to give effectiveness to NU•XYLAN.

**Jerusalem Oak** (125mg): is an herb more commonly recognized as American Wormseed. It has a varied personality and renown amongst the early American Indians for its strengthening of the heart and its ability to promote secretions of the bronchi, kidneys and skin. Its potential gives relief to nervous affections, round worms, and hookworms, intermitted fevers and malaria. Jerusalem Oak was chosen not only as a tonic but a stimulant to urge the sick body to cleanse itself and bring rightness to its work ability. Jerusalem Oak is often called upon for it attention to affections of auditory nerves, hearing problems and infections to the tonsils thus opening tiny passages for freer flow of needed nutrients to heal. When these passages clog up hard and fibroid-like growths and swelling occur.

**Cellulase** (85 cu): provides digestive support as an enzyme working to break down the fiber in fruits and vegetables and grains into smaller units until it can be absorbed through the intestinal wall. Cellulase (not found in the human system) breaks down the bonds in fiber matrices which envelope nutrients in plants to increase nutritional value from fruits and vegetables. Supplementing Cellulase can improve the level of digestion to help assure maximum absorption. Cellulase is actually a complex of distinct enzymes which convert Cellulase to glucose (as simple sugar) needed in the smooth operation of metabolism as an energy source and as building blocks for making complex chemical compounds to supply the body with energy for doing any work.

**Suggested Use**: One (1) tablet, three (3) times a day.
