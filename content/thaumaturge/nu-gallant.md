### MUSCLE INTEGRITY MAINTENANCE

NU•GALLANT belongs to the <cite>Thaumaturge</cite> line of eclectic remedies for those who seek wellness naturally. NU•GALLANT is designed for those who desire to keep their muscles integrity honed and toned. You might want to put NU•GALLANT as a companion support to NU•EGRESS, which addresses muscles too, but only when discomfort comes from an imbalance of the 'pH' factors.

Alone, NU•GALLANT is a metabolic enhancer, which improves and optimizes physical and mental performance during periods of physical stress and is especially beneficial for weight lifters.

Included are:

**Queen-of-the-Meadow** (75 mg): is especially useful for ills of the joints, including aching and sprained back, strains and sprains, pulled ligaments and tendons. It is useful in treating water retention.

**Burdock Root** (45 mg): is often called upon as a blood purifier. It has remarkable abilities to reduce swelling around joints and helps rid calcification deposits. It helps clear the blood of harmful acids. Burdock helps the pituitary gland in releasing an ample supply of protein to adjust hormone balance in the body. A poorly nourished pituitary gland is often responsible for overweight. Famous as a remedy for fevers, gout, nervousness and skin diseases, burdock gives this formula support to intensify muscle strength.

**Red Raspberry** (154 mg): is rich in iron thereby enriching the body�s energy resource. Red Raspberry is good for stopping nausea. It helps with hemorrhoids. Red Raspberry is most usually considered an herb to women reliable to stimulating, toning and regulating the procreative organs, but is also acts as a tonic for the prostate gland. In action, Red Raspberry intensifies hormonal balances, thusly muscles are strengthened.

**Guarana** (62 mg): has a stimulating effect. It is reputed to increase mental alertness and to fight fatigue. It has tonic properties and helps the body reduce water retention. I have added Guarana specifically to harmonize the activity of the lower back muscles. Guarana has a regulating influence on the muscles in general.

**Catuaba** (49 mg): is an obscure herb from South America. It is included in this formula to supplement the enzyme SOD (superoxide dimutase). I wanted that enzyme to be a plant source so I chose Catuaba to increase the sense of well-being and lessen fatigue and help fight diseases associated with aging. Catuaba has been included to aid muscle strength and resilient skin and in general to accentuate a more youthful appearance.

**Calcium Pangamate** (78 mg): is a derivative of apricot kernel included in this formula for improving the health, helping with better performance at exercising programs and greatly enhancing well-being. It increases the muscles� acceptance of prolonged vigorous activity and also improves mental concentration. This highly valuable nutritional supplement helps to increase available oxygen to tissues.

**Grape Seed Extract** (13 mg): is a potent antioxidant of superior power. Its selection for this formula, though, is due to the grape seeds� anti-inflammatory properties, thus it helps muscles respond with smoother resilience to exertion. Grape Seed Extract helps, too, to lessen that tired, sore feeling one feels the next day after a "work out" of physical activity.

**Suggested Use**: One (1) tablet before and after a training program and two (2) additional tablets after a meal.
