### INNER-SELF ENERGY ENHANCER

NU•TOWARD by <cite>Thaumaturge</cite> is designed for those persons who have much stress in the physical and mental realms of their constitution. The defensive powers of their mind are being used up at an above average rate and their nervous energy resources are being easily exhausted. Often there is a feeling of helplessness � unable to cope. NU•TOWARD is designed to give courage and steadfastness.

NU•TOWARD'S possibilities are therapeutic to restore energy potentials in the personality and helping to stabilize harmony. Designed to address issues like depression, feelings of loneliness, sleeplessness, anxiety, emotional hurts, doubts and worries. NU•TOWARD is <cite>Thaumaturge's</cite> gift to troubled people to give new vitality to mind and body. Included in NU•TOWARD are the following ingredients:

**Codonopsis** (320 mg): is a Chinese herb used for its tonic effect, which is mild and gentle in its nature. Especially helpful in this formula, it is a tonic to boost energy deficiency. Codonopsis (for Yin Deficiency) acts on lungs and spleen and is particularly good for nourishing the stomach. An energy tonic, Codonopsis is useful for exhaustion or convalescence.

**Curcumin** (320 mg): is an active ingredient in Tumeric. It has delightful potential in its "all general" attention to inflammation in the joints and muscles. Curcumin has anti-biotic, anti-cancer and anti-oxidant properties and in action protects the liver against many toxins, inhibits platelet aggregation and helps lower cholesterol. I have included it specifically to address chronic tiredness and to enhance energy.

**Alpha-Lipoic Acid** (58 mg): helps to neutralize the effects of free radicals on the body specifically by boosting the antioxidant function of vitamin C, vitamin E and glutathione. It helps too, by assuring the proper function of specific enzymes that convert food into energy. When the body is stressed due to tension, the presence of dangerous free radicals can alter the effectiveness of the immune system and one's health is put in jeopardy.

**Caprylic Acid** (86 mg): has been added to combat candida (a yeast-like fungus) which systematically invades the blood stream, migrating to other areas of the body. The longer one has the infection, the more symptoms one is likely to manifest � recurrent infections, gas, bloating, diarrhea, spastic colon, fatigue, insomnia and constipation. Caprylic Acid has been added as an anti-fungal agent to kill out the yeast. Other herbs in this formula act to build the immune system, along with the Caprylic Acid.

**Witch Hazel** (40 mg): possesses a unique kind of astringency, whose main impetus of affect is on the nervous system, acting to restore tone and vigor throughout the body. It is a premier treatment for hemorrhoids. Witch Hazel lowers blood pressure, accelerates respiration and acts as a reliable astringent. In times of stress and strain, when the body is taxed with emotional disquiets, Witch Hazel helps keep the body decongested to operate at peak level.

**DMG** (Dimethylglycine 86 mg): is a valuable nutritional supplement of human biochemistry. It reduces lactic acid accumulation and associated fatigue to reduce muscular pain. It is used to improve mental concentration. Research projects substantiates that DMG is a valuable aid for strengthening the immune system and increases one's ability to perform with far greater ease. Because DMG increases available oxygen to tissue, blood pressure readings and cholesterol are reduced. When stress and tension become "overriding" the emotional strain is disheartening on the whole body. DMG then accentuates the needed resources to maintain stability.

**Suggested Use**: Two (2) tablets mid-morning and two (2) mid-afternoon. Or at personal discretion up to eight (8) tablets a day.
