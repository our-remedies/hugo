### BOOSTS BODY'S NATURAL HEALING SYSTEM

NU•ADJUNCT is a remedy from the _Thaumaturge_ collection. NU•ADJUNCT heals alone as a sole potential or integrates especially well within a program of other remedies. It is a composite of foods that are specific in their potential to remediate illnesses. Included are cranberry, to address the bladder; zinc, which acts as a boost to the whole immune system; horehound, an old remedy for relieving congestion in mucus membranes; and rosehips, to add tone and healing to inflamed and weakened veins and arteries. NU•ADJUNCT is a formulation designed for you when you don¹t know what to do. NU•ADJUNCT acts as a partner to make other remedies work more effectively.

The following brief paragraphs detail the individual components in NUlADJUNCT. Through these you will understand the logical unlocking of this formula's expertise.

**Cranberry** (365 mg); has been included because it will address bacterial infection in the bladder that in turn creates a pH imbalance in the blood. Muscles begin to ache and lose elasticity and as a result, for more and more of our people, they complain of hurting joints and muscles, especially the knees. A sub-clinical bladder infection is undetected but subtle symptoms are itchy ears, dry and sore throat, a ticky tacky cough, low grade intermittent fevers or chills and low-grade back tiredness. Cranberry alleviates the cause.

**Zinc** (3.5 mg); is a major mineral indicated when tissues wear out faster than they are repaired. One might notice spinal affections, twitching, marked anemia, fidgety feet and weak memory. Zinc is important in the formation of insulin and to protein syntheses. It is indicated for its importance in brain function.

**Horehound** (280 mg); is an often overlooked herb of outstanding healing potential. It was a standby in days of old but in recent years has lost much of its acclaim due to research of other herbs and their rise to fame. Yet, horehound reigns as a superb healer acting as an expectorant and relaxing to the bronchi. It eases congestion; thereby breathing is relaxed and croupy coughs allayed.

**Rosehips**(48 mg); are my favored source of vitamin C, used herein as a kidney tonic and for urinary dysfunctions. Rosehips are cleansing, act as antibacterial, antiviral and anti-inflammatory. Rosehips also act as a sedative and blood tonic.
