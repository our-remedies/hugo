### FIBROUS AND FUNGAL GROWTH REMEDY

NU•TOMBAC as a word deals with temerity or the effrontery in defying the rules. Suited for this formula, the word TOMBAC dares to suggest itself as a remedy for conditions when fibrinous growths impede health. Designed to bring stasis to erratic cell divisions, NU•TOMBAC is a collection of foods that have potential to heal. If a fibrinous growth has already grown or is in progress, NU•TOMBAC is a vibrant protocol; NU•PASSANT follows with its ability to dissolve growth(s).

Each component is listed below with brief characterization to its personality.

**Shavegrass** (60 mg); is one of the finest cleansing herbs we have. It also helps to revitalize the body with the proper amount of silicon. It is an herb good for kidneys, bladder, gas, varicose veins, and mucous membranes. It removes toxic material from the body, good in all ulcer injuries, skin conditions, psoriasis, wounds and sores.

**Stillingia** (415 mg); is a particularly powerful herb. As an alternative, it is an effective glandular stimulant and especially valuable for ridding the "systems" of toxic drugs - particularly, I think, caused by chemotherapy and misuse of pharmaceuticals. Good too for respiratory problems, Stillingia will also give relief to urinary problems. Oddly, Stillingia works best in combination with other herbs.

**Devil's Claw** (525 mg); is a potent anti-inflammatory with action comparable to cortisone. It positively affects diabetes; kidney and bladder disease with help to soften hardened vascular walls. Devil's Claw has properties as natural cleansing agents, which clear the body of toxic impurities especially from the lymph and blood. It is a "sweet" remedy for gallstones and malaria, which is a dormant microbe that lingers in the blood and can resurface once the immune system is labored. Malaria's impact upon the vibrance of the blood is insidious but sorely hurtful.

**L-Ornithine** (500 mg); is an amino acid which specific attributes prompts the release of growth hormones, which promotes the metabolism of excess body fat. Necessary for proper immune system and liver function,

L-Ornithine detoxifies ammonia and helps to regenerate a dysfunctional liver. As a component to healing, L-Ornithine promotes healing and repair of damaged tissues.

**Propolis** (500 mg); is a sterilized resin collected by honeybees used as a putty to seal cracks and openings in the hives and combs. Abundant with flavonoids and uniquely rich in the caffeic acid phenethyl ester propolis inhibits cancer growth. It is renown for its terpenoids which constituents contribute antibiotic, antifungal and antiviral effects.

**Whole Grain Yellow Cornmeal** (48 mg); is a complete protein providing fiber. Enriched with the complexities of amino acids, cornmeal is a brainfood; good for the nervous system. Cornmeal also lowers cholesterol and aids in preventing hardening of the arteries. As a food, it builds bone and muscles. I have chosen cornmeal for its potential to re-ground an erratic electro circuitry. Thusly, the whole healing process is streamlined.

**Suggested Use**: Three (3) tablets at one time a day, on an empty stomach with 6oz. of red or purple grape juice for two (2) months. After second month, one (1) a day for at least one (1) year. Or more, if needed.
